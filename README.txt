# Playground

This respository is full of all my beginner experimental code.
It will contain all my early projects such as flipping codes, first website, etc. 
(Just reminding me of where I started and where anyone can go)
As they get more complicated I will create different repositories. 


This readme file will serve as a "table of contents" to describe what is in this repository.

Flipping_Coins.py
This function is used to simulate a coin being flipped "x" number of times. 
Calculates the average percentage of Heads and Tails. 

Sum_of_num.py
Adds numbers up to a given number for total.
Ex sum_num(8) -> 8+7+6+...+1 = 36.
